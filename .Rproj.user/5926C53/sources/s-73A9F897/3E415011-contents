#----- 1 Generate a random matrix---------------

# let's check the range by using the min and max function

# Now let's visualize this random data and create a heatmap with default settings

#---------- colours----------
# colours are a veyr important compoent of representation of data in the matrix
# colour mapping functions
#allow you to create a fucntion in which a vector of values will result
# in the correspond colours

# If using heatmap(), always use the circlcolorRam2() in order to make a color
# mapping function
# there are two arguements in the colorRamp2
# a vector of break values and their corresponding colors 


# create a color scheme that corresponds to the set values with a rang of -2 to 2
# in this map, the colors aren't affected by outliers
# the color mapping function is robost to outliers

col_fun = colorRamp2(c(-2, 0, 2), c("mediumvioletred", "white", "mediumspringgreen"))
col.fun <- col_fun(seq(-3, 3))
ComplexHeatmap::Heatmap(mat, name = "mat", col = col.fun)
# the negative values are mediumvioletred and the positive are mediumspringgreen

# save as pdf and send to figures folder!
pdf(file = paste(path.figures,"Random Heatmap2.pdf", sep="/"))
ComplexHeatmap::Heatmap(mat, name = "mat", col = col.fun)
dev.off()

# can also create a rainbow color scheme 
ComplexHeatmap::Heatmap(mat, name = "mat", col = rev(rainbow(10)))
# save as pdf and send to figures folder!
pdf(file = paste(path.figures,"Random Heatmap3.pdf", sep="/"))
ComplexHeatmap::Heatmap(mat, name = "mat", col = rev(rainbow(10)))
dev.off()

# if matrix is continuous, provide a vector of colours 
# the colours will be interpolated linearly
# however, mapping isn't robust against outliers
# becasue it starts with the min and max values
# in the matrix

# therefore, if you set the colour to the max/min
# of the matrix, it will be identical to the
# default plot


# can also have colours for a discrete numeric matrix
# and also for character matrix
# default clustering will be applied in the dsicrete plot
# and can be in character plots too if set 



# -----NA---------------
# NA is able to be in matrix
# but you can set the colour so it is identifiable
# the default colour is grey (how do I put this in legend)
# to change the colour use argument
# na_col


# let's try by making the na values black
ComplexHeatmap::Heatmap(mat, name = "mat", na_col = "black")
# it appears that there are no na values.....
# the plot is back to default colour scheme

# add spacing between each value

#-------title-----------------
# describe what the plot is 
# can be set by column and or row
# add titles in the complexheatmap package
# so the funciton column_titles should work for the top.... 
# and the function 
# graphic paramaters can be set by the function gpar
?gpar()
# it is used by get.gpar()

# use the command row_title_gp, or column_title_gp

# now try change the font and title the entire heatmap title
ComplexHeatmap::Heatmap(mat, name = "mat", column_title = "title",

# jk gpar is mean
# mmmm okay I don't know why this isn't working 

# title angles
# in this package you can also change the angle of the titles
# very useful! 



#----clustering-------------
# maybe the most important aspect/function of heatmap visulaization
# there are many clustering methods
# two default: euclidean, and pearson both with pre-determined distance methods 
# hclust, dengrodgram (object or class) that can be/ or already are clustered


# can also turn clustering off, do for rows and then columns
# depending on if clustering is needed or not
