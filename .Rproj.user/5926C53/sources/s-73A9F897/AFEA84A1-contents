#---------- colours----------
# colours are a veyr important compoent of representation of data in the matrix
# colour mapping functions
#allow you to create a fucntion in which a vector of values will result
# in the correspond colours

# If using heatmap(), always use the circlcolorRam2() in order to make a color
# mapping function
# there are two arguements in the colorRamp2
# a vector of break values and their corresponding colors 


# create a color scheme that corresponds to the set values with a rang of -2 to 2
# in this map, the colors aren't affected by outliers
# the color mapping function is robost to outliers

col_fun = colorRamp2(c(-2, 0, 2), c("mediumvioletred", "white", "mediumspringgreen"))
col.fun <- col_fun(seq(-3, 3))
ComplexHeatmap::Heatmap(mat, col = col.fun)
# the negative values are mediumvioletred and the positive are mediumspringgreen


# can also create a rainbow color scheme 
ComplexHeatmap::Heatmap(mat, name = "mat", col = rev(rainbow(10)))

# if matrix is continuous, provide a vector of colours 
# the colours will be interpolated linearly
# however, mapping isn't robust against outliers
# becasue it starts with the min and max values
# in the matrix

# therefore, if you set the colour to the max/min
# of the matrix, it will be identical to the
# default plot


# can also have colours for a discrete numeric matrix
# and also for character matrix
# default clustering will be applied in the dsicrete plot
# and can be in character plots too if set 



# -----NA---------------
# NA is able to be in matrix
# but you can set the colour so it is identifiable
# the default colour is grey (how do I put this in legend)
# to change the colour use argument
# na_col


# let's try by making the na values black
ComplexHeatmap::Heatmap(mat, name = "mat", na_col = "black")
# no na values.....
# back to default colour scheme

#---------- borderds and spacing-------------
# create border by using the border true fucntion
ComplexHeatmap::Heatmap(mat, name = "mat", border = TRUE)


# add spacing between each value

#-------title-----------------
# describe what the plot is 
# can be set by column and or row
# add titles in the complexheatmap package
# so the funciton column_titles should work for the top.... 
# and the function 
# graphic paramaters can be set by the function gpar
?gpar()
# it is used by get.gpar()
get.gpar # idk why this isn't working
get.gpar(mat) # still not working

# mmmmmmm boooooo
ComplexHeatmap::Heatmap(mat, name = "mat", rect_gp = gpar(col = "white", lwd = 2))


# try with another command row_title_gp, or column_title_gp
heatmap(mat, name = "mat", col = col.fun, row_title = "Name", 
        column_title = "Hi")
# mmmm still no
# try the regular plot title function main
heatmap(mat, name = "mat", col = col.fun, main = "Name", 
        ylab = "Right Side", xlab = "bottom")
# wooo!!! 
# not sure how to get labels on the left dendrograms....
# but still cool!
# interesting that normal commands work in this package instead of the
# the suggested ones...


# come back and figure out gpar and why it is being mean


ComplexHeatmap::Heatmap(mat, name = "mat", column_title = "column title", 
        row_title = "row title")
# now change the font and title the entire heatmap title
ComplexHeatmap::Heatmap(mat, name = "mat", column_title = "title", 
                        column_title_gp = gpar(fontsize = 15, fontface = "bold"))
# jk gpar is mean


# title angles
# in this package you can also change the angle of the titles
# very useful! 



#----clustering-------------
# maybe the most important aspect/function of heatmap visulaization
# there are many clustering methods
# two default: euclidean, and pearson both with pre-determined distance methods 
# hclust, dengrodgram (object or class) that can be/ or already are clustered


# can also turn clustering off, do for rows and then columns
ComplexHeatmap::Heatmap(mat, name = "mat", cluster_rows = FALSE)
ComplexHeatmap::Heatmap(mat, name = "mat", cluster_columns = FALSE)
# so odd looking!


# to show clustering on specififcc sides
# for example, show clustering on the right side of rows, and 
# the bottom of the columns
ComplexHeatmap:: Heatmap(mat, name = "mat", row_dend_side = "right", 
                         column_dend_side = "bottom")
